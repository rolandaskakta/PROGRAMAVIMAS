            <p>Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ, is an American
                former professional basketball player and current businessman, who is a minority owner of the
                Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played 15 seasons in the NBA
                between 1984 and 2003, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. Widely considered
                to be one of the greatest players of all time, he was integral in popularizing basketball and
                the NBA around the world in the 1980s andm 1990s,becoming a global cultural icon. He is one of
                the world's richest celebrities...
            <p>

            <p>Jordan played college basketball with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a
                member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982.[ Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as
                the third overall draft pick and emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific
                scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the best defensive players. His leaping ability,
                demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him
                the nicknames "Air Jordan" and "His Airness".Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in
                1991 and followed that with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Citing physical and
                mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom, Jordan abruptly retired before the 1993–94
                NBA season to play Minor League Baseball in the Chicago White ,Sox organization. He returned to
                the Bulls in 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a
                then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.Jordan retired for the second time
                in 1999, returning for two NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.
                He was selected to play for the United States national team during his college and NBA careers,
                winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament
                of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics—while also being undefeated.
