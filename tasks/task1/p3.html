                Kobe Bean Bryant (/ˈkoʊbi/ KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American professional
                basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in
                the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential
                basketball players of all time, Bryant won five NBA championships and was an 18-time All-Star, four-time
                All-Star MVP, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA
                Most Valuable Player (MVP), two-time NBA Finals MVP, and two-time scoring champion. He ranks fourth in
                league all-time regular season and postseason scoring. Bryant was posthumously named to the NBA 75th
                Anniversary Team in 2021 and was a two-time inductee to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame,
                as a player in 2020 and as a member of the 2008 U.S. Olympic team in 2025.

                The son of NBA player Joe Bryant, Bryant was born in Philadelphia and partly raised in Italy. Recognized
                as the top American high school basketball player while at Lower Merion High School in the Philadelphia
                suburb of Ardmore, Bryant declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with
                the 13th pick; he was then traded to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned a reputation as a high-flyer
                by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest and was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite his
                contentious relationship with teammate Shaquille O'Neal, the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive
                NBA championships from 2000 to 2002. In 2003, Bryant was charged with sexual assault. Charges were
                dropped after the accuser refused to testify, and a lawsuit was settled out of court, with Bryant
                issuing an apology and admitting to a sexual encounter he maintained was consensual.
