                William Felton Russell (February 12, 1934 – July 31, 2022) was an American professional basketball
                player who played center for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1956
                to 1969. He was the centerpiece of the Celtics dynasty that played for 12 NBA championships and won 11
                during his 13-year career. Russell is widely considered to be one of the greatest basketball players
                of all time.

                Russell played college basketball for the San Francisco Dons, leading them to consecutive NCAA
                championships in 1955 and 1956. He was named NCAA tournament Most Outstanding Player (MOP), and
                captained the gold medal-winning U.S. national basketball team at the 1956 Summer Olympics. These
                victories along with his NBA championships made Russell one of only eight players in the history of
                basketball to achieve the Triple Crown.

                After being chosen by the St. Louis Hawks with the second overall pick in the 1956 NBA draft, Russell
                was traded to the Boston Celtics for Celtics center Ed Macauley and small forward Cliff Hagan. With
                Russell as their starting center and defensive anchor, the Celtics went on to win their first NBA
                championship in 1957 and won an NBA record eight consecutive championships from 1959 to 1966. A
                five-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) and a 12-time NBA All-Star, Russell's rebounding, defense, and
                leadership made him one of the dominant players of his era. Standing at 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)
                tall, with a 7-foot-4-inch (2.24 m) arm span, his shot-blocking and man-to-man defense were
                major reasons for the Celtics' dominance during his career. Russell also led the NBA in rebounds four
                times, had a dozen consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds, and remains second all-time in
                both total rebounds and rebounds per game. Russell played in the wake of black pioneers Earl Lloyd,
                Chuck Cooper, and Sweetwater Clifton, and he was the first black player to achieve superstar status in
                the NBA. During the final three seasons of his career (1966–1969), he served as player-coach of the
                Celtics, becoming the first black NBA coach to win a championship. Russell ended his playing career
                and left his position as Celtics coach after helping the Celtics win the 1969 NBA championship.
