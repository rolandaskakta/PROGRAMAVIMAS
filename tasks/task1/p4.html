                Kareem Abdul-Jabbar[b] (born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr.,[c] April 16, 1947) is an American former
                basketball player. He played professionally for 20 seasons for the Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles
                Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins
                as a center. A member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Abdul-Jabbar won a record six
                NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards. He was a 19-time NBA All-Star, a 15-time All-NBA Team member, and
                an 11-time NBA All-Defensive Team selection. He was a member of six NBA championship teams as a player
                and two more as an assistant coach, and was twice voted the NBA Finals MVP. He was named to three NBA
                anniversary teams (35th, 50th, and 75th). Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all
                time, Abdul-Jabbar broke the NBA's career scoring record in 1984, and held it until LeBron James
                surpassed him in 2023.

                Abdul-Jabbar was known as Lew Alcindor when he played at Power Memorial, a private Catholic high school
                in New York City, where he led their team to 71 consecutive wins. He played college basketball for the
                UCLA Bruins, winning three consecutive national championships under head coach John Wooden. Alcindor was
                a record three-time most outstanding player of the NCAA tournament. Drafted with the first overall pick
                by the one-season-old Milwaukee Bucks franchise in the 1969 NBA draft, he spent six seasons with the
                team. After leading the Bucks to their first NBA championship at age 24 in 1971, he took the Muslim name
                Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Using his trademark skyhook shot, he established himself as one of the league's top
                scorers. In 1975, he was traded to the Lakers, with whom he played the final 14 seasons of his career,
                during which time the team won five NBA championships. Abdul-Jabbar's contributions were a key component
                in the Showtime era of Lakers basketball. Over his 20-year NBA career, his teams reached the playoffs 18
                times, got past the first round 14 times, and reached the NBA Finals ten times.
